      # Welcome to **Zermatt**

  - message: >
      Join us for another unforgettable event as we explore the magic mountains
      and village surrounding the iconic Matterhorn. We’ll stay in a unique
      Chalet accommodating up to 20 people, equipped with its own gym and SPA as
      well as a hammam.


      Our days will start with yoga or light stretching exercises in the morning
      to adequately prepare us for full days of skiing on the mountain. We will
      be filling (mind the pun!) our days with food from the best the world has
      to offer: from gourmet dining located at 3800m to Rösti at one of the 15
      Gault Millau restaurants. Or would you prefer a Glühwein in an igloo?


      Come for the 360 kilometres of skiing, Europe’s highest cable car or an
      opportunity to play James Bond for a day by cruising down perfectly
      groomed pistes in Switzerland in the morning and in time to sip Chianti at
      lunchtime in Italy (Cervinia). Stay for the good company, the late night
      discussions around a bonfire watching the stars. Unplug (Zermatt is car
      free!) and recharge at the same time.


      Zermatt is more than just the Matterhorn. Relax your mind, engage your
      body and join us for another amazing experience with onepoint55!
